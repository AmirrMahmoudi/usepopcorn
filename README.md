# usePopcorn Project

Welcome to the usePopcorn project! This React-based application is designed to provide movie enthusiasts with a seamless experience to search for movies, rate them, and manage a personal watchlist.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Easily find your favorite movies with our responsive search feature.
- **User Ratings**: Rate movies and see how others have rated them with our integrated star rating system.
- **Watchlist Management**: Keep track of movies you've watched and those you want to see with a personalized watchlist.

## Components

Our application is composed of several reusable components, each serving a unique purpose within the app:

- `Box`: A versatile container that can be toggled open or closed.
- `ErrorMessage`: Displays error messages in a user-friendly manner.
- `Loader`: Indicates loading status to keep users informed during data retrieval.
- `Logo`: Showcases the usePopcorn logo, adding a visual identity to the app.
- `Main`: The core layout component that structures the main view of the application.

- `MovieList`: Lists movies based on search results or watchlist contents.
- `NavBar`: Navigates through the app with ease.
- `NumResults`: Shows the number of movies found from a search query.
- `Search`: A search input field to find movies quickly.
- `StarRating`: Allows users to rate movies and view existing ratings.
- `WatchedMovie`: Details information about movies you've watched.
- `WatchedMoviesList`: Compiles a list of all the movies you've watched.
- `WatchedSummary`: Summarizes your watched movies and ratings.

## Hooks

To enhance functionality and maintain clean code, we've implemented custom hooks:
